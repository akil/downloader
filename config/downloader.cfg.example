    - '[\._ \-]([0-9]{1,3})x([0-9]{1,3})([^\\/]*)'       # foo.1x09
    - '[\._ \-][Ee]?([0-9][0-9][0-9]?)([\._ \-][^\\/]*)' # foo.102 ou foo.10 ou foo.E10
    - '^([0-9]{2,4})[\-_. ]'                             # 01 - foo
    - '\[[Ss]([0-9]+)\]_\[[Ee]([0-9]+)([^\\/]*)'         # foo_[s01]_[e01]


## engines
##  Torrent engine settings. Most of the settings are used for programming purpose. However,
##  for private tracker you need to set login and password.

## out
##  What to do with download torrents. For now, you have two choices :
##    - store : Store the torrent file. In that case, you have to set path to where do you want to save
##              the torrent file. You can let that field empty. In that case, the torrent file can be found
##              at the following path :
##                  - /tmp/tmpCrdzkw.torrent (for GNU/Linux)
##                  - c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\temp\\tmpztclpt.torrent (for windows)
##    - cmd   : Execute a command with freshly downloaded torrent. Only one command exists, that command allows
##              to add the freshly downloaded torrent file into transmission.
##
##  You need to set "choice" settings to "store" or "cmd". By default path for "store" is empty.
##
##  Remark: "home" setting from "cmd" is transmission configuration directory (where settings.json is). That
##          setting is used to store cookies.txt for private tracker. Download URL is submitted to transmission
##          and transmission need the cookie to download from private tracker.
##          Also, for transmission engines can return magnet links.
##          For "cmd" do not forget to set the second parameter (IP address of transmission daemon) and the fourth
##          one (directory for incomplete file). Alternatively you can remove unecessary switch.
